<h4 align="center">Simple JavaScript Rock, Paper, Scissors Game.</h4>

The core of this game was based and inspired on the assignment found in the excellent JavaScript course provided by Dave Gray. simpleRPS expands upon that initial code and adds a couple of QoL-improvements, such as:

- Custom, flex-based front-end
- Clickable buttons are used to play; no typing required.
- Added animations and transitions
- JavaScript code adjustments and improvements
