<h4 align="center">Simple JavaScript Rock, Paper, Scissors Game.</h4>

The core of this game was based and inspired on the assignment found in the excellent JavaScript course provided by Dave Gray. This version of the game is based on code that was provided during the first assignment; the version based on JavaScript browser alerts. simpleRPS expands upon that initial code and adds a couple of QoL-improvements to the table, such as:

- Custom, flex-based front-end
- Clickable buttons are used to play; no typing required.
- Added animations and transitions
- JavaScript code adjustments and improvements
