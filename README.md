Simple JavaScript Rock, Paper, Scissors Game.

The core concept of the game was based on the assignment found in the excellent JavaScript course provided by Dave Gray. However, I've decided to add a couple of QoL-improvements and create my own version.

### Improvements:

- Added a custom HTML and CSS Design to the game.
- Implemented a flex-based design; front-end was designed with mobile-first in mind.
- Changed the browser-styled alerts to Bootstrap modals.
- Added various CSS animations
- Code adjustments and improvements

### Current status:

| Element        | Status  |
| -------------- | :-----: |
| HTML           | **0%**  |
| CSS            | **0%**  |
| CSS Animations | **0%**  |
| JS             | **40%** |
