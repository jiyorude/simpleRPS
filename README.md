<h4 align="center">Simple JavaScript Rock, Paper, Scissors Game.</h4>

This game was inspired by the assignment found in the excellent JavaScript course provided by Dave Gray. simpleRPS expands upon the initial code and adds various QoL-improvements, such as:

- Custom, flex-based front-end.
- Clickable buttons are used to play; no typing required.
- Added animations and transitions.
- Many JavaScript code adjustments and improvements.

A live-environment of the game can be found [here](https://www.github.io/jiyorude/simpleRPS)
